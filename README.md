#Product Demo Project

This project will demonstrate an example use case of SQL and R for data analysis in the software development world.
In my years as a Product Manager, this is a common problem we faced.

We will be using sample customer data to look at purchase rate as it correlates with other customer behaviors and identifies to try to determine specific qualities of customers purchasing more frequently.

We will also analyze frequency as it relates to total spend, to disepher if frequent spending is, in fact, good or not.

The dataset we will be using can be found here: [Kaggle_Customer_Data_Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/e-commerce-customer-behavior-dataset?resource=download)
